Subject: Twilio negotiation portal — dashboards, amendment v2, and portfolio ladder

Hi team,

The Twilio negotiation workspace is live: <<INSERT_GITHUB_PAGES_URL>>

Highlights:
- PRO dashboard with start-date toggles, ladder (32→37→45%), and full SKU analytics.
- SHINY dashboard for exec demos, reading directly from the shared catalog.
- Seed catalog JSON (download-ready) with portfolio coverage across Messaging, Voice, Verify, Flex, Segment, and AI.
- Amendment v2 reflecting the September 15 start, 75% credit, updated ladder, and two-year term.
- Paste-ready assets for finance and legal follow-up.

Let me know once you’ve reviewed; happy to walk through projections or expand the catalog to 120+ SKUs if helpful.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Subject: Align start date, lift suspension, and accelerate growth with consistent portfolio pricing (2-year amendment)

Hi M4,

We want to resolve this cleanly and set both sides up for scale. Below is one package that fixes enablement timing, clears suspension, and locks in consistent, portfolio-wide pricing—so the more we ramp, the more revenue you capture.

1) Account & suspension — immediate relief
  • SID: AC721…d073 (same in contract and collections).
  • Outstanding (pre-enablement): $7,617.71 — July $2,993.50 + $1,927.50; August $2,696.71.
Ask: Apply credits (see §3) and lift the suspension now; we’ll pay the remainder net-30.

2) Timeline — fairness on start/minimums
  • Jul 1, 2025 → contract effective (paper)
  • Aug 12, 2025 → billing enablement
  • Sep 2, 2025 → NET-30 granted
  • Sep 15, 2025 → first operational ramp
Ask: Amend Order Form Start Date / Minimum-Spend commencement to Sep 15, 2025.

3) Pre-enablement credits — zero-usage window
  • Total July–Aug: $7,617.71
  • Credit ask: 75% = $5,713.28; net due $1,904.43 (we’ll pay net-30 post-lift).

4) Spend to date — receipts
  • YTD 2025 (Jan–Aug): $146,520.91 with MoM detail available from our statements.

5) Portfolio discount ladder — consistency (not a favor)
Exhibit A already averages ~32% vs rack (SMS Std $0.0047 vs $0.0083; SMS TF $0.0055 vs $0.0083; Voice Outbound $0.0112 vs $0.014; TF Inbound $0.0154 vs $0.022).
Ask: Apply that consistency across ~100 SKUs (Messaging, Voice, Verify, AI, Numbers, Lookup, Conversations, Flex, Studio/Functions, Segment, SIP).
Ladder: Tier A 32% → Tier B 37% (> $250k trailing-90) → Tier C 45% (> $1M trailing-90).
Why Twilio wins: at Tier C our 24-month cumulative spend ≥ $13.9M. Deeper discounts → bigger adoption → higher absolute Twilio revenue.

6) Two-year term
We’ll commit to a 2-year amendment—predictable revenue for Twilio, stable pricing for us.

7) Cost-per-Client (lead economics)
Inputs: leads/month, words/message (→ segments), Verify attempts %, conversion %, voice minutes, revenue/sale.
Outputs (current funnel): CPE ≈ $0.28, CPC ≈ $28–$50, gross margin per sale vs $120+ revenue.
Binds pricing to customer-level ROI—transparent and scalable.

8) Transparency — live model & workbook
  • Interactive dashboard (public link):
👉 https://acmltd105.github.io/twilio-portal/
(PRO and SHINY dashboards linked from the landing)
  • Excel “one truth” mirrors the dashboard (Rates_Full, Ladder, Inputs, 24M projection).
We’re happy to attach the workbook and walk through it live.

Summary ask (one clean amendment)
  • Amend start/minimums → Sep 15, 2025.
  • Apply 75% credit to July–Aug; pay remainder net-30.
  • Adopt portfolio ladder (32 → 37 → 45%) across ~100 SKUs.
  • Sign a 2-year term.
  • Accept dashboard + Excel as the transparent baseline.

Best,
