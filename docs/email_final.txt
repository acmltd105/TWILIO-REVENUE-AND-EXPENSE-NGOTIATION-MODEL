Subject: Twilio negotiation portal — dashboards, amendment v2, and portfolio ladder

Hi team,

The Twilio negotiation workspace is live: <<INSERT_GITHUB_PAGES_URL>>

Highlights:
- PRO dashboard with start-date toggles, ladder (32→37→45%), and full SKU analytics.
- SHINY dashboard for exec demos, reading directly from the shared catalog.
- Seed catalog JSON (download-ready) with portfolio coverage across Messaging, Voice, Verify, Flex, Segment, and AI.
- Amendment v2 reflecting the September 15 start, 75% credit, updated ladder, and two-year term.
- Paste-ready assets for finance and legal follow-up.

Let me know once you’ve reviewed; happy to walk through projections or expand the catalog to 120+ SKUs if helpful.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
