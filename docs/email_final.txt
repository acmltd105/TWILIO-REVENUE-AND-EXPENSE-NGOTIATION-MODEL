Subject: Align start date, lift suspension, and accelerate growth with consistent portfolio pricing (2-year amendment)

Hi <EXEC NAME>,

We’re ready to move decisively. One clean package: start date to Sep 15, 75% pre-enablement credit, 32→37→45% portfolio ladder, 2-year term, and a live dashboard + Excel that maps to your revenue story. Link below.

Highlights:
1. **Start date + suspension:** We align the effective date to 15 September, lift the suspension immediately, and assign the architect/CSM duo within five business days.
2. **Portfolio ladder:** Trailing-90 automation governs the move from 32% → 37% → 45% on the full cross-channel portfolio. The dashboard shows the tier math live and the daily Slack ping keeps the team honest.
3. **Enablement credit:** 75% of the first-quarter portfolio commitment is issued as a pre-enablement credit, visible on the first invoice.
4. **SKU transparency:** Messaging, Verify + Conversations, Flex, Segment, Email, and AI Assist are all catalogued with their list assumptions so finance and ops can inspect the path to M4 revenue.

Action items:
- Review the amendment (markdown download is on the landing page for quick legal markup).
- Run your latest leads/engagement/conversion inputs in the PRO dashboard to see cost-per-engagement and the ladder jump.
- Reply-all with approval or redlines, or drop your questions in the Slack thread and we can resolve same-day.
