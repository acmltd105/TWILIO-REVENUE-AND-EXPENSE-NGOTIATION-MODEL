# Final Email Draft to Twilio

**Subject:** Locking in our transparent growth partnership

Hi [Twilio Partner Name],

Thank you again for the collaboration and the candid guidance as we mapped out the revenue and expense levers together. I wanted to close the loop by putting the full proposal in one place so we can move to signature.

---

### 1. Summary of the amendment we are ready to sign
- **Go-live:** September 15, 2025 (amends the July–August ramp).
- **Ladder:** Maintain the 100-SKU catalog while rebalancing to the 32% / 37% / 45% tiers (32% baseline, 37% up to $250k trailing-90, 45% beyond $1M trailing-90).
- **Consistency:** Keeps the pre-agreed Exhibit A consistency portfolio across the rack so that the weighted average still lands at ~32%.
- **Cost-per-engagement guardrails:** Inputs = leads, words per message, Verify attempts (%), message volume mix, revenue per sale. Outputs = $0.28–$0.52 CPE, $28–$50 CPC depending on funnel conversion, with gross margin per sale tracked against $120+ revenue per conversion.
- **Predictability:** 24-month term, aligning to Twilio’s preference for predictable revenue and our clients’ migration schedule.

### 2. Transparency + shared instrumentation
- **Dashboard:** GitHub Pages site (`index_brand.html`) with contract-vs-rack variance, CPI/CPA/CAC tornado sensitivity, usage by SKU (100 total, with “green” lock markers), and live trailing-90 projections. URL is ready—just let us know the preferred auth scope.
- **Excel (“one-truth”):** `twilio_sku_catalog.xlsx` mirrors the dashboard and includes the Fulfillment, Ladder, Inputs, and Projections tabs. This is the workbook we will treat as the system of record.
- **Reporting cadence:** Weekly async snapshot + monthly working session. Variance to target will always be annotated with root cause + corrective action.

### 3. Why this is a win-win
- **Fair:** No minimums before enablement and credits for voice innovations remain intact.
- **Consistent:** The ladder keeps the 32% average across the board, honoring the economics we already agreed in Exhibit A.
- **Growth-aligned:** Deeper discounts unlock adoption across the portfolio, pushing us past the $13.9M annualized spend target.
- **Predictable:** The two-year term levels out procurement and cash planning for both teams.
- **Transparent:** Live dashboard + Excel ensures shared truth on usage, cost, and ROI.

### 4. Next steps (we can execute immediately)
1. **Deploy GitHub Pages bundle** – `/docs` is zipped and ready; once we receive the target GitHub org/project we will push and share the URL.
2. **Confirm Settings → Pages → Source = main /docs** – keeps the dashboard public behind the right controls.
3. **Attach Excel** – `twilio_sku_catalog.xlsx` accompanies this email for reference.
4. **Countersign** – we are ready to execute upon receipt of the Twilio signature packet.

Let me know if you’d like to walk through the dashboard together or if Procurement needs any additional documentation. Otherwise, we are aligned and ready for signature this week.

Appreciate the partnership.

Best,

Alan Ives  
Founder & CEO, [Company Name]
