# Launch Readiness Checklist

This checklist consolidates the remaining actions required to complete the Twilio negotiation launch, based on the sanitized documentation in this repository.

## Negotiation & Contracting
- Confirm counter-party availability to complete the client negotiation kick-off, which is still in progress on the approval timeline. 【F:docs/timeline/approval-timeline.md†L7-L13】
- Prepare final redline review and signature routing so contract finalization can close on schedule. 【F:docs/timeline/approval-timeline.md†L7-L13】
- Resolve open concessions before the amendment is signed, including volume commit adjustments, support plan upgrades, and data retention clauses. 【F:docs/timeline/contract-terms.md†L9-L25】

## Financial Operations
- Close the dispute on invoice INV-2024-03 and settle any outstanding balance that remains under review. 【F:docs/financials/invoice-history.md†L1-L16】
- Review February 2024 variance drivers (messaging and voice increases) to ensure the revised contract tiers align with observed usage. 【F:docs/financials/spending-records.md†L1-L15】

## Dashboard & Reporting
- Add negotiation-specific cost-center tags to the BI dashboard so stakeholders can isolate impacted spend. 【F:docs/dashboard/dashboard-overview.md†L1-L20】
- Schedule sanitized weekly dashboard exports that feed the negotiation briefing packets. 【F:docs/dashboard/dashboard-overview.md†L21-L23】

## Access & Security
- Verify that the partially masked Twilio Account SID remains accessible to the authorized negotiation, finance, and legal users listed in the SID confirmation. 【F:docs/financials/twilio-sid-confirmation.md†L1-L20】

## Communication
- Publish the finalized negotiation portal link and ensure the highlights in the outbound email remain accurate before sending the launch message to stakeholders. 【F:docs/email_final.txt†L1-L62】
