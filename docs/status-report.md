# Implementation Status Report

## Branch Inventory
- Only the `work` branch is present in the local repository clone. No additional feature or release branches exist to merge.

## UI and Wiring
- The repository contains analytical Python code and documentation assets. There is no existing React/Tailwind front-end or Supabase/Twilio integration codebase to complete or wire together.
- Because those application layers are not present, no user interface build, integration wiring, or deployment preparation steps can be executed at this time.

## Deployment
- No deployable application artifacts exist in the repository. Consequently, there is nothing that can be deployed to a local runtime or hosted URL for immediate testing.

## Next Steps
1. Obtain or create the missing application source code (React UI, backend services, Supabase schemas, and Twilio integration modules).
2. Introduce environment configuration, build scripts, and deployment pipelines aligned with the desired architecture.
3. Once the application code is available, run the relevant build and test suites, address discovered defects, and only then proceed with deployment.

This report documents the current repository state so that stakeholders can plan the required implementation work.
